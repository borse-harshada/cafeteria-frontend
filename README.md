The Student Cafeteria Menu Manager is a digital system that lets students view menus, check prices, and place pre-orders online. It helps reduce queues, avoid food wastage, and save time for both students and staff. The system includes authentication, menu management, ordering, billing, and feedback modules, all supported by a centralized database for real-time updates. It makes cafeteria services more transparent, organized, and user-friendly, while also enabling future features like mobile apps, QR-based pickup, and AI meal suggestions.
